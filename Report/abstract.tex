    Since the invention of the computer, it has become an essential tool in modern physics. Everything from the generation of advanced weather models to the fundamental act of measuring observables is not done without the aid of computers.
    
    In this project we have successfully implemented a RISC-V processor in Synchronous Message Exchange, which is a tool used for rapid development of circuits for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Furthermore using vendor synthesis tools it has been shown to run at a theoretical speed of 124 MHz.
