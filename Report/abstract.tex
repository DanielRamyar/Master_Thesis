    Since the invention of the computer, it has become an essential tool in modern physics. Everything from the generation of advanced weather models to the fundamental act of measuring observables is now done with the aid of computers.
    
    To address the ever growing demand for increased computational power and the inevitable end of Moore's law, alternate processor architectures, such as the RISC-V, has to be considered, as current standards are beginning to reach their limits. 
    
    In this project we have successfully designed, implemented and tested a RISC-V processor in Synchronous Message Exchange, which is a tool used for rapid development of circuits for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Furthermore using vendor synthesis tools it has been shown to run at a theoretical speed of 124 MHz.
