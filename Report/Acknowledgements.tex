    \textbf{Acknowledgments}
\end{center}

Firstly would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor Brian Vinter for providing me with the opportunity to write my thesis at the eScience group.

Thanks to Kenneth Skovhede, Alberte Thegler and Carl-Johannes Johnsen for providing feedback during the project at the weekly meetings. I would especially thank Carl-Johannes who has provided a tremendous amount of help throughout my time at the eScience group, all from providing crucial feedback for my thesis to synthesizing the VHDL code used to determine the speed of the processor.

I would like to thank my friend Erkan Karatas, who has been proof reading my thesis without hesitation.
