    \subsubsection{Logical identity}
        
        Hereafter we have the logical identity operator which we will represent as the function $I(x)$. The logical identity operator takes an argument and returns it as is. 
        
        A logic table for the identity operator has been created and can be found in table \ref{LogicTable:Identity}. In the first column we find our preposition $p$ and its arguments. In the second column we find the return values of the identity operator with the prepositions as the argument $I(p)$.
        
        \begin{table}[h!]
            \centering
            \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            	\hline
            	  $p$   & $I(p)$  \\ \hline
            	$true$  & $true$  \\ \hline
            	$false$ & $false$ \\ \hline
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Logic table of the identity operator where the proposition p, which is either true or false, can be found in the first column. In the second column we find $I(p)$, which is the identity operator with $p$ as its argument, and its return values.}
            \label{LogicTable:Identity}
        \end{table}
        
    \subsubsection{Logical true}
        
        Next we have logical true which we will represent as the function $T(x)$. Logical true takes an argument and always returns true.
        
        A logic table for the true operator has been created and can be found in table \ref{LogicTable:True}. In the first column we find our preposition $p$ and its arguments. In the second column we find the return values of the true operator with the prepositions as the argument $T(p)$.
        
        \begin{table}[h!]
            \centering
            \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            	\hline
            	  $p$   & $T(p)$ \\ \hline
            	$true$  & $true$ \\ \hline
            	$false$ & $true$ \\ \hline
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Logic table of the true operator where the proposition p, which is either true or false, can be found in the first column. In the second column we find $T(p)$, which is the true operator with $p$ as its argument, and its return values.}
            \label{LogicTable:True}
        \end{table}
    
    \subsubsection{Logical false}
        
        Lastly we have logical false which we will represent as the function $F(x)$. Logical false takes an argument and always return false.
        
        A logic table for the false operator has been created and can be found in table \ref{LogicTable:False}. In the first column we find our preposition $p$ and its arguments. In the second column we find the return values of the false operator with the prepositions as the argument $F(p)$.
        
        \begin{table}[h!]
            \centering
            \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            	\hline
            	  $p$   & $F(p)$  \\ \hline
            	$true$  & $false$ \\ \hline
            	$false$ & $false$ \\ \hline
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Logic table of the false operator where the proposition p, which is either true or false, can be found in the first column. In the second column we find $F(p)$, which is the false operator with $p$ as its argument, and its return values.}

\label{appendix:Binaray_Operators}
    \subsubsection{Joint denial}
        Joint denial is represented by $\downarrow$ in mathematics or NOR in computer science and commonly referred to as the NOR operator. The NOR operator results in a true value only if both operands are false.
        
        Using table \ref{LogicTable:PossibleOperators} we see that the set of outputs which corresponds to this definition is column 15 and is summarized in table \ref{LogicTable:NOR}.
        
        Here we have the propositions $p$ and $q$ in the first two columns and all possible permutations between them in the following rows. The last column then shows the resulting value after doing the NOR operation between $p$ and $q$.

            	$true$  & $false$ &     $false$      \\ \hline
            	$false$ & $true$  &     $false$      \\ \hline
            	$false$ & $false$ &      $true$      \\ \hline

            \label{LogicTable:NOR}
        \end{table}
        
        In disjunctive normal form the NOR operator can be expressed in the following form
        \begin{equation}
            p \downarrow q = (\neg p \wedge \neg q)
        \end{equation}

    \subsubsection{Alternative denial}
        Alternative denial is represented by $\uparrow$ in mathematics or NAND in computer science and commonly referred to as the NAND operator. The NAND operator results in a true value only if one or more of the operands are false.
        
        Using table \ref{LogicTable:PossibleOperators} we see that the set of outputs which corresponds to this definition is column 5 and is summarized in table \ref{LogicTable:NAND}.
        
        Here we have the propositions $p$ and $q$ in the first two columns and all possible permutations between them in the following rows. The last column then shows the resulting value after doing the NAND operation between $p$ and $q$.

            	$false$ & $true$  &     $true$     \\ \hline
            	$false$ & $false$ &     $true$     \\ \hline
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Logic table of the NAND operator where $p$ is the first proposition and $q$ is the second. All possible permutations are then specified in each row for each proposition. The third column then shows the resulting value of the NAND operation between $p$ and $q$.}
            \label{LogicTable:NAND}
        \end{table}
        
        In disjunctive normal form the NAND operator can be expressed in the following form

All possible permutations are then specified in each row for each proposition. The third column then shows the resulting value of the material implication operation between $p$ and $q$.}
            \label{LogicTable:MI}
        \end{table}
        
        In disjunctive normal form the material implication operator can be expressed in the following form
        \begin{equation}
            p \rightarrow q = (p \wedge  q) \vee (\neg p \wedge q) \vee (\neg p \wedge \neg q)
        \end{equation}
        using the procedure mentioned in chapter \ref{section:Boolean_algebra}.
    
    
    \subsubsection{Converse implication}
        Converse implication is represented by $\leftarrow$ in mathematics. The converse implication operator results in a false value only if the first operand p is true and the second q is true.
        
        Using table \ref{LogicTable:PossibleOperators} we see that the set of outputs which corresponds to this definition is column 3 and is summarized in table \ref{LogicTable:CI}.
        
        Here we have the propositions $p$ and $q$ in the first two columns and all possible permutations between them in the following rows. The last column then shows the resulting value after doing the converse implication operation between $p$ and $q$.

    \subsubsection{Material nonimplication}
        Material nonimplication is represented by $\not\rightarrow$ in mathematics. The material nonimplication operator results in a true value only if the first operand p is true and the second operand q is false.
        
        Using table \ref{LogicTable:PossibleOperators} we see that the set of outputs which corresponds to this definition is column 13 and is summarized in table \ref{LogicTable:MNI}.
        
        Here we have the propositions $p$ and $q$ in the first two columns and all possible permutations between them in the following rows. The last column then shows the resulting value after doing the material nonimplication operation between $p$ and $q$.
